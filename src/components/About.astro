<div class="about">
  <p>
    PMsky as a platform began from the question: how can we collaboratively
    curate the social web without affording special privileges to anyone in
    particular?
  </p>
  <p>
    The main curator of any internet platform is the company running it, and
    companies do need to moderate their platforms. But, they can't do it all and
    too often they don't make the right calls.
  </p>
  <p>
    Bluesky has <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/4-13-2023-moderation"
      >composable moderation</a
    >, which allows anyone to run a labeler & provide an additional layer of
    moderation to anyone who subscribes.
  </p>
  <p>
    This allows for experimentation and exploration. Existing labelers still
    tend to be run by one or a few people at most, which <a
      href="https://docs.pmsky.social/getting-started/why-peer-moderation#:~:text=third%20party%20moderation%20also%20has%20its%20own%20drawbacks"
      >can cause issues</a
    >.
  </p>
  <p>
    The vision behind PMsky is one where labels can be determined by wide public
    consensus, not just individual opinions.
  </p>
  <p>
    The goal of this platform is to aggregate as many opinions as possible and
    make that information available to labelers. Those labelers can then
    incorporate this data into how they decide to moderate.
